Title : Rendering data to Templates

1 - How does send any variable(present in views.py file) along with its values to html file?
    Go to views.py file.
    Then make a variable and set its value.
    Now in render function after location pass a dictionary.
    Note: key of the dictionary will be used as a variable in html file.
    e.g:
    def products(request):
    productsList = Products.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'accounts/products.html',{'products':productsList})
