Title : Create, Update and Delete (CRUD) with model forms

(Now we created order_form.html file then we created forms.py)

1 - What is model meta?
    Model Meta is basically the inner class of your model class. It is basically used to change the behavior of your model fields. Itâ€™s completely optional to add a Meta class to your model.

2 - How does the model meta use in our model?
    We add meta class in our model to add model meta:
    class className(models.Model):
        class Meta:
            options...

3 - What are the different meta options?
    Some of the options of meta class are as follow:
    abstract:
        If abstract = True, model will be an abstract base class
    
    app_label:
    If a model is defined outside of applications in INSTALLED_APPS, it must declare which app it belongs to:

    verbose_name:
        verbose_name is basically a human-readable name for your model

    ordering:
        Ordering is basically used to change the order of your model fields.

    For more options you can refer the following link:

4 - Why do we use fields = '__all___' in form.py file?
    This is saying that go ahead and create a form with all of the fields present in that table. 
    If you want to spcify some of the fields of a model then use list
    e.g:
    fields = ['field1','field2']

5 - What does redirect do?
    It is used to redirect from one page to another page.
