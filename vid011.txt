Title : Inline Formsets

1 - How does to fill any specific field of a form?
    To fill any specific field of a form we use initial attribute
    initial = {'field name' : value }
    e.g: 
    You can refer form = OrderForm(initial={'customer':customer}) in createOrder function in accounts/views.py file

2 - Why we use inline fomrset?
    Django formset allows you to edit a collection of the same forms on the same page.
    It basically allows you to bulk edit a collection of objects at the same time.
