Title : Database Relationship

1 - What is one to one relationship?

2 - What is many to many relationship?

3 - Why we use ForeignKey?
    To define a many-to-one relationship, we use ForeignKey.

3 - How to add ForeignKey?
    class Order(models.Model):
        cus = models.ForeignKey(Customer)
    In this example Customer can be associated with many Order objects
    on_delete tells what to do when a parent value is deleted

4 - What are the various options for on_delete?
    a) CASCADE
        delete the reference object will also delete the referred object
        e.g:
        A post has comments, when the Post is deleted, all the comments on that Post will automatically delete. We don't want a comment saving in the database when the associated Post is deleted.

    b) PROTECT
        It works just opposite of the CASCADE.
        e.g:
        All the comments on a post will remain save even if that post is deleted

    c) SET_NULL
        First we need to set the value of null argument as True then only we can use it.
        When the referenced object is deleted, the referencing value will be updated as NULL.
        e.g:
        If a post is deleted, then all the comments will be set as NULL.
