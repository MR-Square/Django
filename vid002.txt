2 - How to create url for different pages?
    To add url pattern for different pages we use "path()" function in urlpatterns list as an element.
    e.g:path('', Home, name='home-page'),
        path('about/',About),
        Home and About are the name of function which will be run when urser will enter the corresponding pattern in search bar.


3 - We have defined three functions in accounts/views.py file.


4 - we have also created one file named urls.py in accounts folder. Then we will import path and make one list named as urlpatterns
        import line:
        from django.urls import path
        creating list:
        urlpatterns = []
    In this list we will create different path for different pages.


5 - Now we will import views file in accounts/urls.py file then we will add path for all functions which we have defined
    import:
    from . import views
    paths: this is just for example.
    path('products/',views.products)
